# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): 
a technique where an AI retrieves up-to-date information from external sources before generating answers. This means an AI assistant could fetch the latest data on the internet or even your private document store, and then summarize or answer questions based on current information, bypassing the static limits of its training data.

Real-Time RAG takes this a step further by ensuring that as soon as data changes, the AIâ€™s knowledge and responses change with it. The result? Answers that are not only contextually accurate but also instantly updated with live information, greatly reducing outdated responses and AI hallucinations.
